I am currently a scientist and a research leader at [ASAPP](https://www.asapp.com/) where I manage a group of researchers and engineers for natural language processing (NLP) and applied machine learning. 
Prior to joining ASAPP, I completed my PhD at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 2017. I was advised by [Prof. Regina Barzilay](https://www.regina.csail.mit.edu/) and worked in the [NLP group](http://nlp.csail.mit.edu/) at [CSAIL](http://www.csail.mit.edu/).
I obtained my bachelor of science degree from [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn/) in 2010.



Broadly speaking, I am interested in the algorithmic perspective of machine learning and various applications of natural language processing. My recent research focuses on the following topics:
- **Efficient ML**: devise neural network models that can scale at training or inference while retaining state-of-the-art results on target applications ([EMNLP18](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.02755.pdf), [ICML17](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.09037)); and build novel learning algorithms for model compression ([EMNLP20a](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.emnlp-main.496.pdf), [EMNLP20b](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.emnlp-main.494.pdf)).

- **Rationalizing model prediction**: introduce self-explaining models that selects a subset of input as a justification for the models prediction ([EMNLP16](https://people.csail.mit.edu/taolei/papers/emnlp16_rationale.pdf), [ACL20a](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.13111.pdf)); or thru interacting with the user ([ACL20b](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.237.pdf)).
